# Burn Rate PWA Setup

Your Burn Rate app is now configured as a Progressive Web App (PWA) and ready for PWABuilder!

## What's Been Set Up

### 1. Web App Manifest (`/public/manifest.json`)
- Complete manifest with app name, description, and icons
- Standalone display mode for native app feel
- Portrait orientation for mobile devices
- Theme color matching your green flame branding (#26D962)
- App shortcuts for quick actions

### 2. Service Worker
The service worker is automatically generated by `vite-plugin-pwa` during the build process. It provides:
- Offline support
- Automatic caching of assets
- Auto-update when new versions are available
- Runtime caching for external resources

### 3. PWA Configuration in Vite
The `vite.config.ts` file now includes the `vite-plugin-pwa` plugin that:
- Automatically generates an optimized service worker
- Handles service worker registration
- Manages cache strategies
- Supports offline functionality

## Testing Your PWA

### Local Testing
1. Build your app: `npm run build`
2. Serve the build locally with a tool like `npx serve dist`
3. Open Chrome DevTools → Application tab → Service Workers to verify registration
4. Check Manifest tab to verify manifest is loaded correctly

### PWABuilder Process
1. Go to [PWABuilder.com](https://www.pwabuilder.com)
2. Enter your deployed app URL
3. PWABuilder will analyze your manifest and service worker
4. Download the Android and iOS packages
5. Follow PWABuilder's instructions to publish to app stores

## What PWABuilder Will Check

✅ **Web Manifest** - Your app has a complete manifest.json
✅ **Service Worker** - Automatically generated during build
✅ **HTTPS** - Required when deployed (not for localhost)
✅ **Icons** - SVG icons work for all sizes
✅ **Display Mode** - Set to "standalone" for app-like experience
✅ **Theme Color** - Matches your green flame branding

## Icon Recommendations

Your app currently uses SVG icons which work for PWAs. However, for best compatibility with PWABuilder and app stores, you may want to:

1. Create PNG versions of your logo in these sizes:
   - 192x192 (required for PWA)
   - 512x512 (required for PWA)
   - 1024x1024 (recommended for app stores)

2. Update the manifest.json to include PNG icons:
```json
{
  "src": "icon-192.png",
  "sizes": "192x192",
  "type": "image/png",
  "purpose": "any"
},
{
  "src": "icon-512.png",
  "sizes": "512x512",
  "type": "image/png",
  "purpose": "any"
},
{
  "src": "icon-maskable-512.png",
  "sizes": "512x512",
  "type": "image/png",
  "purpose": "maskable"
}
```

## Build for Production

Run `npm run build` to create the production build. The service worker will be automatically generated in the `dist` folder.

## Additional Features

The service worker provides:
- **Offline Mode**: Your app works without internet
- **Fast Loading**: Assets are cached for instant loading
- **Background Sync**: Can be extended for background operations
- **Push Notifications**: Infrastructure ready for notifications (if you add them later)

## Next Steps

1. Build your app with `npm run build`
2. Deploy to a hosting service with HTTPS (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
3. Test the PWA functionality in production
4. Use PWABuilder to package for mobile app stores
