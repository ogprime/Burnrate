  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: January 23, 2026</p>

  <div class="highlight">
    <strong>TL;DR:</strong> Burn Rate stores all your data locally on your device. We don't collect, transmit, or store any personal information on servers. Your meeting history never leaves your device.
  </div>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Burn Rate ("we", "our", or "the app") is a meeting cost calculator designed to help you track the cost of meetings in real-time. This privacy policy explains how we handle your information.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    Burn Rate collects and stores the following information <strong>locally on your device only</strong>:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Meeting Data:</strong> Number of attendees, hourly rate, meeting duration, and calculated costs</li>
    <li><strong>Meeting History:</strong> Past meeting records you've saved</li>
    <li><strong>App Preferences:</strong> Your last-used settings (attendees count, hourly rate)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong>Important:</strong> All data is stored in your browser's local storage. No data is transmitted to external servers, databases, or third parties.
  </p>

  <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>
    The information stored locally is used solely to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Calculate meeting costs in real-time</li>
    <li>Display your meeting history</li>
    <li>Remember your preferences between sessions</li>
    <li>Enable the "Share Receipt" feature (images are generated locally on your device)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> All data is stored using browser localStorage on your device</li>
    <li><strong>No Cloud Backup:</strong> We do not back up your data to any cloud service</li>
    <li><strong>Device-Specific:</strong> Your data is tied to your specific device and browser</li>
    <li><strong>Clearing Data:</strong> You can clear all data at any time by clearing your browser's storage or uninstalling the app</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    Burn Rate does not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. We do not integrate with:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Google Analytics or other analytics platforms</li>
    <li>Advertising networks</li>
    <li>Social media tracking pixels</li>
    <li>External databases or APIs</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Sharing Your Information</h2>
  <p>
    We do not share, sell, rent, or transmit your information to any third parties because:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>All data stays on your device</li>
    <li>We have no servers to collect or store data</li>
    <li>We have no business model that involves selling data</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong>Share Receipt Feature:</strong> When you use the "Share Receipt" feature, the image is generated locally on your device. You control where and how to share it (via your device's native share functionality).
  </p>

  <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Burn Rate is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children. Since all data is stored locally and we don't collect any information on servers, we have no ability to access user data of any age.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
  <p>
    You have complete control over your data:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Access:</strong> All your data is visible in the app's interface</li>
    <li><strong>Delete:</strong> Clear your browser's local storage or uninstall the app to remove all data</li>
    <li><strong>Export:</strong> Use the "Share Receipt" feature to export individual meeting records</li>
    <li><strong>No Account:</strong> No account registration means no personal information is ever collected</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>9. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>
    Data is retained in your browser's local storage indefinitely until you:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Clear your browser's cache and cookies</li>
    <li>Uninstall the app</li>
    <li>Manually delete meeting records in the app</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>10. Progressive Web App (PWA) Functionality</h2>
  <p>
    Burn Rate uses PWA technology to work offline and be installable on your device. This means:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>A service worker caches app files locally for offline use</li>
    <li>No network requests are made when working offline</li>
    <li>The app continues to function without an internet connection</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>11. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date. Since we don't collect contact information, we cannot notify you directly of changes.
  </p>

  <h2>12. International Users</h2>
  <p>
    Since all data is stored locally on your device and we don't operate servers, there are no international data transfers. Your data never leaves your device.
  </p>

  <h2>13. Contact Information</h2>
  <p>
    If you have questions about this privacy policy, you can contact us at:
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Email:</strong> [YOUR_EMAIL_HERE]<br>
    <strong>Website:</strong> https://burnrate-gamma.vercel.app
  </p>

  <h2>14. Legal Compliance</h2>
  <p>
    This privacy policy is designed to comply with:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</li>
    <li>California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</li>
    <li>Google Play Store requirements</li>
    <li>Apple App Store requirements</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Since we don't collect or process personal data on servers, most data protection regulations don't apply in the traditional sense.
  </p>
